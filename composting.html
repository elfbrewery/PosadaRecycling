				<p>
				A Green Cone is a "food waste digester" that has been used successfully by individual homes and by
				municipalities around the U.S. for decades. We had 2 Green Cones installed at Posada, located in the far SW
				and NW corners of the park, near the highway.
				</p>
				<br/>
				We started with the SW cone then added the NW cone, behind the garage buildings. The SW cone blew away in a hurricane, but has 
				been replaced with a blue rollable barrel.
				We haven't had pigs to eat our garbage this year, but, for the record, pigs eat most anything. Some of the items 
				they do not eat - including eggshells, coffee grounds, etc. -- can be put in the Green Cone or other composter.
				UNFORTUNATELY, NO CITRUS IN THE PIG BUCKETS OR THE CONE. Citrus rinds take too long to decompose, so rinds go into your trash.
				<p>
				The cone has a perforated basket buried beneath it, and the top has a locking tab that it's important to secure after
				each use to keep critters out and moisture in. (The tab on the NW cone is broken, so we're putting a rock on top
				of the lid that you should replace whenever you use it.)

			<p>
				To turn food waste into compost, the cone requires "<strong>green</strong>" matter - your vegetable waste - as well as "<strong>brown</strong>" matter, like dead leaves, straw and shredded paper. Whenever you add food waste to the cone, add a handful or two of
				brown waste, which we'll try to keep a supply of next to the cone.
			</p>				
			<p>
				Small things decompose much faster than big things, so it will help speed up the process if you cut up your raw
				veggie waste as you make it. Keeping a colander in your sink and/or a small, lidded bucket under your sink for
				ongoing waste collection will streamline the process in your kitchen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Do NOT put fish carcasses and guts in the cones. Please take these out to sea for disposal.
			</p>
			<p>
				Between these 2 systems, we have significantly reduced the amount of waste going into the trash bin and over to the
				dump across the road. Yay!

			<h3 class="article-header"> <br/><br/> Pig Feeding</h3>
			<p>
				When pigs are being tended at Posada, there will be locations where food scraps can be placed in buckets.
				Our guards fed the two pigs we had in 2010 and 2016.

				FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
			</p>
			<p>
				Q: Will/should pigs eat:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>bones?</li>
				<li>raw fish?</li>
				<li>tougher vegetable skins like melon, avocado?</li>
				<li>veggies or leftovers that are clearly rotten -- i.e., with mold on them?</li>
				<li>dairy products that have turned sour?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				A: All of the things mentioned are great pig food, with the exception of raw fish with bones. The only peelings
				pigs don't like are citrus rinds, and dry corn husks (as in tamale wrappings). Sour milk and moldy stuff is fine.
				Almost any leftover cooked foods are good, including meat scraps, and of course, peelings, lettuce outer leaves,
				old bread, etc. I noticed some cooked rice in the digester (Green Cone). That would have been perfect pig food.
			</p>
			<p>
				Q: Anything else we should not feed the pigs?
			</p>
			<p>
				A: Pigs will not eat coffee grounds, tea bags, or paper. Please use the Green Cone for these items. Citrus should
				go into the trash by default.
			</p>
			<p>
				Q: I heard someone say that pigs typically need a vaccination against trichinosis. One of these pigs is destined
				for a spring pig roast here at Posada, and people will want to know that it's safe to eat the meat. What do you
				advise?
			</p>
			<p>
				A: As to trichinosis concerns, there is nothing to worry about in that regard. Any pork that is cooked well, as in a
				pig roast, would be perfectly safe. If anyone has ever eaten a pig roast at Ana's (Lupita's) or Serinidad he/she has
				consumed the same type of local pig meat we will be enjoying. Our pigs are also getting some supplemental
				grain and cull dates, which is very good.
